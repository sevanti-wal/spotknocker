									Conditions are to Protect the both of us. Here at Spot Knocker
									we want to make sure everybody is having a good time. Lets sit
									back, grab a drink and have a good time.</p>
									<br>
								<p>This page explains our terms of use. When you use Spot
									Knocker, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page. Some of
									them need to be expressed in legal language, but we’ve done our
									best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what
									everything means.</p>
									<br>
								<p>Welcome to Spot Knocker. By using this website (the
									“Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”)
									offered by Spot Knocker, PBC (together with its parents,

								<p>We may change these terms from time to time. If we do,
									we’ll let you know about any material changes, either by
									notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email. New
									versions of the terms will never apply retroactively — we’ll
									tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using
									Spot Knocker after a change, that means you accept the new
									terms.</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker is for your personal, non-commercial use,
									except as explained in section 4 and section 5 below.</p>

							<div class="policy-header">Things You Definitely Shouldn’t Do</div>
							<div class="policy-text">
								<p>This section is a list of things you probably already
									know you shouldn’t do — lie, break laws, abuse people, steal
									data, be uncool, hack other people’s computers, and so on.
									Please behave yourself. Don’t do this stuff.</p>
								<p>Millions of people use Spot Knocker. We expect all of
									them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place.
									Don’t do any of these things on the Site:</p>
								<p>Don’t break the law. Don’t take any action that infringes
									or violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or
									breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.</p>
								<p>Don’t lie to people. Don’t post information you know is
									false, misleading, or inaccurate. Don’t do anything deceptive
									or fraudulent.</p>
								<p>Don’t offer prohibited items. Don’t offer any rewards
									that are illegal, violate any of Spot Knocker’s policies,
									rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute,
									ordinance, or regulation.</p>
								<p>Don’t victimize anyone. Don’t do anything threatening,
									abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene,
									profane, or invasive of another person’s privacy.</p>
								<p>Don’t spam. Don’t distribute unsolicited or unauthorized
									advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or
									chain letters. Don’t run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of
									auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.</p>
								<p>Don’t harm anyone’s computer. Don’t distribute software
									viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to
									interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware,
									or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Spot Knocker or
									another party).</p>
								<p>Don’t abuse other users’ personal information. When you
									use Spot Knocker — and especially if you create a successful
									display — you may receive information about other users,
									including things like their names, email addresses, and postal
									addresses. This information is provided for the purpose of
									participating in a Spot Knocker Display: don’t use it for other
									purposes, and don’t abuse it.</p>
								<p>We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and our
									systems function properly. So don’t do any of these things —
									most of which boil down to “don’t mess with our system.”</p>
									<br>
									<p>Don’t try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.</p>
									<p>Don’t bypass any measures we’ve put in place to secure the Services.</p>
								<p>Don’t try to damage or get unauthorized access to any
									system, data, password, or other information, whether it
									belongs to Spot Knocker or another party.</p>
								<p>Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load
									on our infrastructure, or on our third-party providers. (We
									reserve the right to determine what’s reasonable.)</p>
								<p>Don’t use any kind of software or device (whether it’s
									manual or automated) to “crawl” or “spider” any part of the
									Site.</p>
								<p>Don’t take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Spot
									Knocker in an effort to access things like source code,
									underlying ideas, or algorithms.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="policy-header">How Dispays Work</div>
							<div class="policy-text">
								<p>Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with
									Spot Knocker. This section is different — it explains the
									relationship between Display owners and users who upload
									content to Spot Knocker Displays either owned by Spot Knocker
									or privately owned displays, and who’s responsible for what.
									This is what you’re agreeing to when you create or upload to a
									Spot Knocker Display</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker provides a revenue generating platform for
									it’s users. . When a user buys a subscription to a full screen
									display on Spot Knocker, they’re inviting other people to form
									a contract with them. Anyone who post content to a display is
									accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract.</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker is not a part of this contract — the
									contract is a direct legal agreement between display owners and
									the users who upload to them. Here are the terms that govern
									that agreement:</p>
								<p>When a user successfully uploads to a display, the owner
									of such display must complete and fulfill the offer and display
									all content upload by it’s users. Once a display owners has
									done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their users. .</p>
								<p>Throughout the process, display owners owe their users /
									Spot Knocker’s a high standard of effort, honest communication,
									and a dedication to bringing their content to life. At the same
									time, users / Spot Knocker’s must understand that when they
									upload to a display, they’re helping to create something new —
									not doing something that already exists. There may be changes
									or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that
									prevents the display owner from being able to display the
									content as promised.</p>
								<p>If a Display owner is unable to display content, they’ve
									failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement.
									To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find
									another way of bringing the content to the best possible
									conclusion for user’s / Spot Knocker’s. A display owner in this
									position has only remedied the situation and met their
									obligations to backers if:</p>
								<p>they 100% refund the user / Spot Knocker.</p>
								<p>they work diligently and in good faith to bring the
									content to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s
									communicated to user / Spot Knocker;</p>
								<p>they offer to return any remaining funds to user’s / Spot
									Knocker’s who have not had their content displayed.</p>
								<p>(Bottom line) If a user / Spot Knocker uploads content
									that is not a lie, break laws, abuse people, steal data, be
									uncool, hack other people’s computers, and so on. Owners of a
									display must 100% refund the user / Spot Knocker.</p>
								<p>The display owner is solely responsible for fulfilling
									the promises made. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of
									this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by user /
									Spot Knocker.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="policy-header">How buying into a Display Works</div>
							<div class="policy-text">
								<p>This section goes over the details of buying a Spot on a
									user's display. Spot Knocker believes that giving it’s users
									the power to work together makes the world a better place.
									Buying Spots and creating content is what it’s all about.
									Advertising is way too expensive, and with your help we’ll
									change that. In this section when you buy a Spot we will go
									over — things like how money gets collected, whether pledges
									can be changed or canceled, and how display owners can contact
									backers to provide refunds if there's a problem. .</p>
								<p>These are the terms that apply when you’re buying time /
									spot on a spot knocker owned or a privately owned display:</p>
								<p>You will be charged for the Spot you selected. It’s your
									responsibility to make sure the display you’re uploading to is
									on a properly functioning. Spot Knocker is in no way liable for
									refunds on it’s users displays. Spot Knockers users display are
									all private and refunds are handled by display owners “Not Spot
									Knocker”.</p>
								<p>Once you upload and pay for content to be displayed to
									any particular display. You can’t cancel it. “It’s a go”
									“1,2,3, blast off!!”</p>
								<p>The Estimated Delivery Date is the display owner's
									calendar. When it’s scheduled, it will play.</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker doesn’t offer refunds. Responsibility for
									finishing a display lies entirely with the display owner. Spot
									Knocker doesn’t hold funds on display owners behalf, cannot
									guarantee display owners’ work, and does not offer refunds.</p>
								<p>These are the terms that apply when you’re creating a display:</p>
								<p>You can refund user’s / Spot Knocker’s if you want. After
									your display has been funded, you can cancel and refund a
									user's / Spot Knocker’s pledge at any time. If you do, you have
									no further obligation to that specific user / Spot Knocker, and
									no agreement exists between you.</p>
								<p>We'll help resolve payment-card disputes. If a user/ Spot
									Knocker of your project disputes the charge with their card
									issuer, we'll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the
									dispute with the card issuer. You’ll be notified that a dispute
									has been filed, and you’ll be able to provide evidence to help
									us resolve it in your favor. If the cardholder’s dispute is
									found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number
									you provided when you started your dispaly for the amount of
									the chargeback.</p>
								<p>Don’t be a Dick. Just don’t do it, it’s not cool.</p>

							<div class="policy-header">Stuff We Don’t Do and Aren’t Responsible For</div>
							<div class="policy-text">

								<p>What is Spot Knocker's copyright policy?</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker has adopted a general policy regarding
									copyright in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright
									Act of 1998. Spot Knocker removes material that is the subject
									of a compliant DMCA takedown notice. Section 512 of the DMCA
									provides the rules for reporting copyright infringement and for
									filing a counter-notification.</p>
								<p>If you believe your copyright is being infringed, you can
									report the alleged violation.</p>
								<p>If your project was the subject of a takedown notice, you
									can submit a counter-notification.</p>
								<p>Spot Knocker has adopted a policy of, in appropriate
									circumstances, terminating user accounts that are repeat
									infringers of the intellectual property rights of others. Spot
									Knocker also may terminate user accounts based on even a single
									infringement. How do I report a copyright violation?</p>
								<p>If you're not sure whether material on Spot Knocker
									infringes on your copyright, please consult with an attorney
									before filing a DMCA notification. Misrepresenting that
									material infringes on your copyright may subject you to
									liability for damages, including costs and attorney's' fees
									incurred by Display Creators or other parties.</p>
								<p>If you believe that your copyright is being infringed,
									please contact us.</p>
								<p>What happens to my content if the display I posted to is
									subject to a copyright dispute?</p>
								<p>If your content becomes the subject of a copyright
									dispute and Spot Knocker removes part or all of the content
									from public view, you’ll get an email that explains the status
									and next steps. Any material that becomes subject to a
									copyright dispute will be removed until the dispute is
									resolved.</p>
								<p>We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>

							<div class="policy-header">Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</div>
							<div class="policy-text">
								<p>We’re located in Lakeport, CA, and any disputes with us
									have to be handled in Lakeport, CA under California State law.</p>
								<p>We at Spot Knocker encourage you to contact us if you’re
									having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the
									unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these
									Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines
									incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in
									accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the
									United States, without giving effect to any principles of
									conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform
									Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations
									Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods. You
									agree that Spot Knocker and its Services are deemed a passive
									website that does not give rise to jurisdiction over Spot
									Knocker or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assigns,
									employees, agents, directors, officers, or shareholders, either
									specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State
									of California. You agree that any action at law or in equity
									arising out of or relating to these Terms, or your use or
									non-use of Spot Knocker, shall be filed only in the state or
									federal courts located in lake County in the State of
									California, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal
									jurisdiction of these courts for the purposes of litigating any
									such action. You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may
									have to trial by jury in any dispute, action, or proceeding.</p>

								<p>These are our official terms and our rules for how things
									work. (So if you ever see confusing or conflicting information
									about any of this stuff, just check these terms — they’re the
									last word.) Thanks so much for reading them, and for using Spot
									Knocker!</p>
									<br>
								<p>These Terms and the other material referenced in them are
									the entire agreement between you and Spot Knocker with respect
									to the Services. They supersede all other communications and
									proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you
									and Spot Knocker with respect to the Services and govern our
									future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found
									to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or
									eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms
									otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
									The failure of either you or Spot Knocker to exercise any right
									provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver
									of any other rights.</p>
								<p>These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them,
									transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Spot Knocker’s
									prior written consent. Spot Knocker has the right to assign,
									transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under
									these Terms without your consent. Spot Knocker will provide you
									notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting
									the notice on our Site.</p>
